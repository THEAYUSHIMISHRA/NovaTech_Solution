## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a web-based executive dashboard designed to address **"Problem Statement 1: Solving the Growth Equation"** for NovaTech Solutions. 

It provides a data-driven diagnosis of the company's current growth crisis—characterized by skyrocketing Customer Acquisition Costs (CAC) and a broken sales funnel—and visualizes a comprehensive 3-pillar strategy to scale revenue from **$12M to $100M** over 18 months.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive Data Storytelling:** Uses a tabbed interface to separate the "Crisis Diagnosis" from the "Strategic Solution."
* **Dynamic Visualizations:** Features interactive charts (Bar, Doughnut, Line) built with **Chart.js** to visualize:
    * Unit Economics (CAC vs. LTV)
    * Sales Pipeline Velocity & Bottlenecks
    * Revenue Trajectory & ROI Projections
* **Executive Reporting:** Includes a custom "Export to PDF" feature with print-optimized styling for stakeholder presentations.
* **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structure and responsive styling.
* **JavaScript:** For dashboard logic and tab switching.
* **Chart.js:** For rendering responsive, data-driven charts.

## 📊 Data Source
All metrics and projections are derived from the *NovaTech Case Study Analysis* and *Problem Statement 1* documents.
